Description: Encoded cURL wrapper for penetration testing
 ecurl is a lightweight shell wrapper around curl designed to simplify
 testing of input encoding and injection payloads during authorized
 penetration tests. It provides multiple encoding strategies (URL,
 double URL, HTML, Base64, Unicode), session/cookie management,
 batch payload testing, JSON metadata output for tool-chaining and a
 simple command history. For authorized security testing only.
